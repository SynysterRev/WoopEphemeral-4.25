This project was completed in 3 months by 4 programers with Unreal Engine 4. In this game you have to finish the levels as quickly as possible.
To do that, you will have some tools at your disposal :

your legs to move, jump and walljump

fire your right fist to trigger interuptors or destroy walls !

use a grappling hook and a dash to defy the laws of gravity
